- Constructed the service layer using **Java** **Servlet**.

### **Dublin Bus Journey Time Prediction Web App** | Graduate Project  `Jun 2020 – Aug 2020`

- Developed a **RESTful** Web App with **Python** **Django** framework for request handling. Applied Google Map API to represent the bus stop location and the journey time between sites.
- Implemented Tree-Based **Machine Learning** Model to predict the bus traveling with the date time and the weather pattern.
- Performed **exploratory data analysis(EDA)** on the historical bus timetable with the weather data to estimate the bus journey time at different bus routes and date times.
- Deployed web application via the **Docker** container on the **Heroku** PaaS.
- Constructed the database of historical weather data and bus arriving time at the different bus stations with the relational model using **MySQL**.

### **Dublin Bus Journey Time Prediction Web App** | Software Engineering  `Feb 2020 – Apr 2020`

- Developed **RESTful** WebApp with **Python** **Flask** framework handing the request from uses on Google map. Predict the hourly availability of bike stations by Light Gradient Boosting **Machine Learning** Model using weather pattern as features.
- Visualized the average usage and historical trend on Google Map by Javascript library **Chart.js**.
- Managed the project with the **Scrum** team under the scheme of **agile development** methodology using **Jira** as the management tool.

### **Face Generation Machine** | Udacity  `Feb 2020 – Apr 2020`

- Implemented **Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network(DCGAN)** with PyTorch to generate the unknown human face.
- Optimized the model with soft-labeling, leaky-rule activation function, and exponential learning decay techniques
